Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster


DESCRIPTION
------------

This is a Kaggle prediction competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic. This project is done as part of machine learning final project (group project).

The code was written in Python using Anaconda's Jupyter Notebook.

The code can be run by opening Anaconda Navigator, launching Jupyter notebook and opening the ipynb file or copy pasting the code from the python file.

Click on Cell, Run all cells. 

We used scikit packages for visualizing data, preprocessing, model building and evaluating the models using performance measures like roc curve, area under the roc, accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score.

We referred to the scikit documentation for performing the above steps.


BACKGROUND
-----------
RMS Titanic was a British passenger ship that collided with an iceberg during its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City and sank in the North Atlantic Ocean. It is estimated that there were 2,224 passengers and crew aboard the ship and more than 1,500 died, making it one of the deadliest maritime disasters in modern history. The incident led to major changes in maritime regulations to implement new safety measures such as ensuring the availability of more lifeboats, proper implementation of lifeboat drills and round the clock management of wireless equipment on passenger ships.
Titanic has gone down in history as the ship that was called unsinkable and she is the inspiration of this challenge. In this challenge, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster, we will analyze what sorts of people were likely to survive in the Titanic disaster. We will be applying tools and techniques of Machine Learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy. Our goal is to build a binary classification model that will classify the passengers into one of the two classes: class 0 or class 1. Class 0 will represent that the passenger didnâ€™t survive, and Class 1 will represent that the passenger survived.
